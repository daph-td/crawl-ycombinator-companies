Tassomai’s multiple choice micro-quizzes reinforce knowledge through targeted repetition, like a flashcard. At the same time the algorithm is learning each student’s strengths and weaknesses; it uses this information to target the gaps in a student’s knowledge and provide feedback to teachers on which areas individuals and entire classes need help with. Tassomai saves teachers time in two ways; it teaches AO1s, while also reducing the time they need to spend analysing their students, meaning they can focus on teaching and targeting intervention.
