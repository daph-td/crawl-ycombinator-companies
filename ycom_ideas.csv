Available as Open Source & Enterprise. By implementing Vue Storefront, you will improve your overall User Experience and lift up your revenues but at least 20%. 

1. Lightning Fast
We are on the mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  
a) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. 
b) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  
c) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 

Loading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  
a) Walmart found that for every 1 second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  
b) Increase of conversion % at each stage of Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) 

2. Fast Time To Value
Vue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those API’s by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. 

Also, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. 

3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS
Headless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. 

It allows business users to edit the content & publish with no-code approach

4. Fast learning curve for developers  
We use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!

- It's only one file, so you can write CI configurations without looking at docs
- Our runners are fully featured VMs, and we take memory snapshots instead of just the filesystem so you can restore a configured Redis instance from a previous pipeline.

Benefits:
- We're a developer laptop in the cloud: your tech stack can come in any shape
- Get a unique link to share the frontend changes for every commit - we'll spin up the environment whenever it's requested, so you don't have to pay to keep them up
- CI runs significantly faster because you can set up your environment (e.g., `docker-compose up -d`) once, and rewind to that snapshot for every following pipeline.
- It's easier to onboard team members because they just have to read the single Layerfile to understand the whole CI process (incl. how to install everything)

https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/guruhotel,GuruHotel,The Shopify for the hotel industry.,"GuruHotel is Shopify for the hotel industry. Independent hotels use our software to rebuild their hotel website, drive more direct bookings from online travel agencies (OTAs), and generate 30% more revenue. 

We have decades of experience building products and leading companies in the hotel industry, including founding and selling LastRoom, the HotelTonight for LATAM.

That’s where we learned that 73% of people who find a hotel room on Booking.com or Expedia also check the hotel website to see if the price is cheaper.  Independent hotels are missing these opportunities because they haven’t figured out that they should offer extras, discounts, and better user experience in order to drive bookings on their websites to avoid paying 15-25% commissions to OTAs.  We help them automate all of this.

Why now - Shopify did this for e-commerce allowing them to pull their content from Amazon - we will do this for hotels allowing them to gain freedom from Booking and Expedia.",https://guruhotel.com,2019,18,Mountain View,Josue Gio ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/josuegio,Stiven Martinez,https://www.linkedin.com/in/stivenmartinez/,NA,NA
